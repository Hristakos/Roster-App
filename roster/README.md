# Roster Application
This is an application which will help small businesses to create roster with their available staffs. Managers will be able to view, create, update and delete the roster. Staffs will be able to view roster and they will get the notification when the roster is published. Staffs can swap the shifts or offer their shifts to other staffs, if they are unable to do a shift. Managers will be able to view total hours worked in certain day, week or month. Both managers and staffs must be logged in to use the system.
